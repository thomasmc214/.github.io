  <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a self-taught developer</h3>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>My name is Tom, and this is my story about how (at the age of 56)
      I decided to become a self-taught developer.</p>
    <p>My story begins roughly a year and a half ago, while browsing through 
      the magazine section at the local Barnes & Noble I came across a "bookazine"
      about programming in "Python". Python is a great first language to learn 
      for an aspiring programmer, it reads and writes very much like the natural
      English language and as such is fairly easy to pick up. Throughout my course of
      study I learned that Python is very useful in developing websites as well as web apps.
      And so I decided to branch out a bit and delve into developing for the web, afterall
      these days we conduct most of our lives through the World Wide Web.</p>
      <p>And so that brings us to the present date, as I sit here as an aspiring Web developer.
      I can tell you that so far, this is one of the most exciting adventures that I have ever
      embarked on. If you would like to join me on this journey please bookmark my page and 
      follow me on instagram and Twitter. I would love to connect and hear from you, please 
      feel free to reach out to me through my social media accounts. Until then, here's 
      to an exciting and prosperous 2021 for all of us.</p>
