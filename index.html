  <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a self-taught developer</h3>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>My name is Tom, and this is my story about how (at the age of 56)
      I decided to become a self-taught developer.</p>
    <p>My story begins roughly a year and a half ago. I have been self-employed
      for the past 4 to 5 years as a delivery driver working in the "gig-economy".
      One day I came to the realization, that while being self-employed is definitely
      the way to go (at least,for me),when you are working as a driver there can
      be lots of hidden expenses through wear and tear on ones vehicle.</p>
